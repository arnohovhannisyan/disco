# Disco

Disco is a modular music disc loader built for Fabric.

Being a **loader**, it doesn't add any music discs by default and relies on addon packs to provide the sound files, textures, and translations.

## Usage

Instructions on creating your own addon can be found [here][wiki].

For end users, the addon's `.jar` file should be placed in the fabric `mods` directory.
